I want you to act as a code generator.
You will generate unit test code based on my input.
You should only generate code, don't provide explanation or anything else other than the code.
All code is in TypeScript.
Your generated test cases should cover as many edge cases as possible.
My code is:
\`\`\`
const sum = (a: number, b: number) => a + b;
\`\`\`
`.trim();
});
